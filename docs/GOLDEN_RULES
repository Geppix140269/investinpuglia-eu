# üèÜ GOLDEN RULE #4: COMPONENT MODIFICATION PROTOCOL

## NEVER MODIFY EXISTING COMPONENTS WITHOUT:

1. **EXPLICIT DECLARATION**
   - State EXACTLY which file is being modified
   - List EXACTLY which functions/features are being changed
   - Explain WHY the change is necessary
   - Show WHAT other components might be affected

2. **CHANGE SUMMARY FORMAT**
   ```
   üìù MODIFICATION NOTICE:
   - FILE: [exact file path]
   - FUNCTION: [function name being modified]
   - CHANGE: [what is changing]
   - REASON: [why this change]
   - AFFECTS: [what else might be impacted]
   - PRESERVES: [what functionality remains intact]
   ```

3. **BACKUP FIRST**
   - Always create a backup version comment
   - Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to remove
   - Test that existing features still work

4. **EMAIL FUNCTIONALITY IS SACRED**
   - The AUTO_EMAIL system must NEVER be removed
   - Contact form functionality must ALWAYS work
   - Email triggers must remain sensitive and proactive

## Example:
```
üìù MODIFICATION NOTICE:
- FILE: components/trullo/TrulloChatbot.tsx
- FUNCTION: sendAutomatedEmail
- CHANGE: Adding debug logging
- REASON: To troubleshoot email sending
- AFFECTS: Console output only
- PRESERVES: All email functionality intact
```
