## üìù SESSION NOTES

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Skip Calculator API** - Removed unused code to fix build
2. **Focus on Directory** - Core monetization feature
3. **Manual First, Automate Later** - Build trust before charging
4. **Self-Service Registration** - Scalable growth model

### Challenges Overcome
1. Multiple build errors requiring different solutions
2. Missing API routes causing 404 errors
3. Database table creation and relationships
4. TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Learning Points
1. Next.js API routes must be in `route.ts` files
2. Dynamic routes need `[param]` folder syntax
3. `useSearchParams()` requires Suspense boundary
4. API routes don't use `'use client'` directive
